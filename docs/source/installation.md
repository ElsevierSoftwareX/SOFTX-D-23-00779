# Installation

snapper-ml supports Python 3.6 and above.

We use [Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/) for hyperparameter optimization,
so as Ray currently supports MacOS and Linux only, Windows support
will be available as soon as this framework supports it.

We recommend installing snapper-ml using Pip:

```bash
pip install snapper-ml
```
